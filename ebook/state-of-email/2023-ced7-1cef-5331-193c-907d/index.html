<h2 id="the-top-7-email-marketing-myths-debunked">The Top 7 Email Marketing Myths Debunked</h2>
<p><span style="color:grey">Email marketing myths too many people believe (and shouldn&#39;t).</span></p>
<p>Usually, myths are harmless, but there are a few myths in email marketing that you might believe in that could end up being detrimental to your campaign. So, let&#39;s start on the right foot by addressing any email marketing myths and misconceptions to ensure you have a better email marketing experience in 2023.</p>
<h3 id="myth-1-its-a-good-idea-to-removehide-the-unsubscribe-button-to-reduce-unsubscribes">Myth #1: It&#39;s a good idea to remove/hide the unsubscribe button to reduce unsubscribes.</h3>
<p><strong>Fact: By removing the unsubscribe button, you will lower the number of unsubscribes. But is it a GOOD idea? Definitely not.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Increase your chances of landing in spam</strong><br>When you remove the unsubscribe button, you are caging people in your email list. This will only enrage them and encourage them to report you by marking your emails as spam. Thus your domain reputation will go down the drain, and your emails will start landing in spam. By doing this, you are essentially shooting yourself in the foot and ruining your email marketing efforts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Legal reasons</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Firstly, you will be violating the GDPR, as per which you are required to provide an easy way for people to opt out. The GDPR&#39; Article 7(3) reads:​</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her​ consent at any time […] It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.&quot;​</strong></p>
<p>When you remove the unsubscribe button, you will violate this, and this action could have financial and legal consequences. Read more about the <a href="../../../guides/gdpr/index.html#fines-for-non-compliance-to-gdpr-email-marketing?utm_source=ebook&amp;utm_medium=stateofemail2023&amp;utm_campaign=link">consequences of GDPR violations</a> in our guide.</p>
<p>You will also be violating other legal policies like the <a href="../../../guides/can-spam/index.html%3Futm_source=ebook&amp;utm_medium=stateofemail2023&amp;utm_campaign=link.html">CAN-SPAM</a> Act.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Damages your credibility and reputation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you remove the unsubscribe option from your emails, you are taking away the right to consent from your subscribers. That’s not ethical and will jeopardize your brand image and credibility for building a long-term relationship with your audience.</p>
<h3 id="myth-2-avoiding-spam-trigger-words-can-help-you-land-in-the-inbox">Myth #2: Avoiding spam trigger words can help you land in the inbox</h3>
<p><strong>Fact: No. By simply avoiding spam words, you can no longer avoid the spam folder.</strong></p>
<p>Back in the 1970s and 80s when email marketing became popular, spam filters used to look out for several spammy words to understand which emails were spam and which weren’t. And email marketers could avoid those words to avoid triggering spam filters. But, spammers had also used this technique to enter the inbox, so spam filters had to become smarter to stop spammers.</p>
<p>So, spam filters used by mailbox providers and internet service providers started to look beyond just a few words to identify spammers. As we mentioned previously factors like IP and domain reputation, authentication, email engagement, etc. play a bigger role in determining whether your emails will land in spam.</p>
<p>So, you need to focus on the above-mentioned factors rather than trying to avoid spam words if you want to land in people’s inboxes. Read this <a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/why-spam-trigger-words-are-a-thing-of-the-past/">article</a> by Litmus to get more information about this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Use Targeted List: Always send out emails to a very targeted list of people who have opted in to receive your content. If this is not done, it will increase your unsubscribe rate and your spam rate.”

<h3 id="myth-3-google-is-killing-amp-emails">Myth #3: Google is killing AMP emails</h3>
<p><strong>Fact: Google is deprioritizing AMP HTML for the web, not AMP for Emails.</strong></p>
<p> People have misinterpreted the phrase “Google kills AMP” that has been going around everywhere as Google killing AMP for Email, but that is not true. Google has deprioritized AMP HTML for web pages.</p>
<p>Previously Google has been ranking web pages with Google AMP integration higher because they had allegedly prioritized those using their tech. But, in April 2021, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/amp/about-amp">Google</a> announced that AMP would no longer be considered a ranking factor for web pages. Read this <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad/">article</a> to know more about how Google “killed” AMP web pages. So clearly, this has nothing to do with AMP for Email, which remains unscathed.</p>
<p>In fact, interactive emails are here to stay. Microsoft recently developed its version of interactive emails called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/">Actionable Messages</a>. Actionable Messages are similar to AMP emails, allowing users to engage with the email without leaving the inbox. However, they are still limited as they can only be used internally to send to certain Office 365/Exchange Online Server users. Whereas AMP for emails is supported by Gmail, Yahoo, Mail.ru, and FairEmail. </p>
<h3 id="myth-4-amp-emails-will-automatically-help-improve-email-deliverability">Myth #4: AMP emails will automatically help improve email deliverability.</h3>
<p><strong>Fact: Not necessarily.</strong> </p>
<p>To send AMP emails, people must complete all the sender id authentication protocols and get whitelisted with Gmail, Yahoo mail, or Mail.ru. And while authentication can help improve your chances of landing in the inbox, it&#39;s not necessarily guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>Email deliverability is more than just authentication.</strong> Several other factors determine whether or not your emails will get delivered to the inbox, like IP &amp; domain reputation, sender reputation, email sending frequency &amp; volume, email list acquisition &amp; hygiene practices, etc.</p>

<h3 id="myth-5-emojis-in-the-subject-line-can-cause-deliverability-issues">Myth #5: Emojis in the subject line can cause deliverability issues</h3>
<p><strong>Fact: Emojis don&#39;t cause deliverability issues.</strong></p>
<p> There is no data available to prove that using emojis will increase your chance of landing in spam.</p>
<p>Some people have seen a correlation between emojis and spam in their campaigns, but it&#39;s usually not the emojis themselves but how they have been used. If you use them in a way that annoys your audience or makes you seem suspicious, they might mark your email as spam.</p>
<p>For example, if your subject line is <strong>“❤️ Valentine’s Day sale 10% off 🎁”</strong> your audience might not have a problem with the subject line. But if you overuse emojis or use inappropriate ones like <strong>“❤️❤️❤️ Valentine&#39;s Day 🍑🍑🍑,”</strong> it might prompt them to mark you as spam.</p>
<p>Also, overuse of emojis can cause accessibility issues as it would be a bad experience for people who use screen readers. For example, this is how a screen reader would read these subject lines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>❤️ Valentine’s Day sale 10% off 🎁</strong> - “Red heart Valentine’s Day sale 10% off wrapped gift”</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>❤️❤️❤️ Valentine&#39;s Day 🍑🍑🍑</strong> - “Red heart Red heart Red heart Valentine’s Day sale 10% off peach peach peach”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some best practices you can follow if you want to add emojis to your subject line:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use only one emoji per subject line if you could.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put it at the end of the subject line like <strong>“Valentine’s Day sale 10% off 🎁.”</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t use emojis in between the subject line as they break the sentence flow when read by screen readers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>“In 2023, it&#39;s time to stop treating emails as transactional pieces of content. Instead, it is time to delight your end users with the kind of content that they&#39;d like to read and talk to them in their language, as you would with a friend. And get your basics right — accessibility and readability across platforms and devices.”

<h3 id="myth-6-its-okay-to-send-image-only-emails">Myth #6: It’s okay to send image-only emails.</h3>
<p><strong>Fact: No, it&#39;s not.</strong></p>
<p>Brands usually send them because it&#39;s easier to create these than an HTML or AMP email. But it’s a bad strategy to send image-only emails for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility issues</strong>
Your email will not be accessible to everyone as screen readers or voice assistants used by blind and visually impaired individuals cannot read text inside an image.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Potential spam issues</strong> 
Image-only emails are generally used by spammers as spam filters can&#39;t read the text in images. So, email clients usually block image-only emails from being delivered or route them to the spam folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Failure to load or Increase in load time</strong>
When the reader&#39;s internet is slow, your image-only email will not load immediately. So they might have to wait a while to know what your email is about or might never be able to read it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bad reader experience</strong>
Image-only emails are usually not dark mode friendly as they have a certain background color that doesn’t change in dark mode. So readers are taken aback by the bright background when they are accustomed to reading with a dark background.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you try to make the image dark mode-friendly by using a PNG image with no background, it won&#39;t work. This is because while the background is now dark in dark mode, the text is also dark making it impossible to read.</p>
<p>And there are other issues associated with image-only emails, like responsiveness. All you need to know is that image-only emails are not worth it, and you’ll see better results with normal emails like all text, HTML, or AMP.</p>
<h3 id="myth-7-unsubscribes-are-a-bad-sign">Myth #7: Unsubscribes are a bad sign.</h3>
<p><strong>Fact: Not always true.</strong></p>
<p>Unsubscribes might be devastating for marketers who assume it means they are failing in their marketing efforts. But that&#39;s not the case - unsubscribes can be a good thing.</p>
<p>Unsubscribe action shows that the person wasn&#39;t an engaged prospect or is someone who is no longer interested in your offering. So they wouldn&#39;t have bought from you even if they had stayed. Unsubscribe events help you to have a filtered list of people who are interested in your product.</p>
<p>So, going forward, don’t dwell on the number of unsubscribes. Rather, focus on engagement (open rate, CTOR) and conversions. And, if you avoid a high unsubscribe number, you should implement a <a href="../../../guides/sunset-policy/index.html%3Futm_source=ebook&amp;utm_medium=stateofemail2023&amp;utm_campaign=link.html">sunset policy</a> and remove inactive prospects from your list before they choose to unsubscribe.  </p>

<h3 id="how-was-this-survey-conducted">How was this survey conducted?</h3>
<p>The survey was conducted primarily through email campaigns using Mailmodo. We created interactive forms so people could fill out the survey inside the email.</p>
<p>We sent the survey emails to our subscribers, marketing audience, and previous survey respondents. We used our social media platforms and newsletters to distribute the survey. We also reached out to industry thought-leaders and who’s who of email to get their invaluable input.</p>
<p>We collected data from 150+ marketers with the help of a questionnaire that was carefully converted into insights and drafted into this report by our in-house team.</p>
<h3 id="what-were-the-survey-topics">What were the survey topics?</h3>
<p>Our team created a questionnaire comprising 50 questions covering email marketing objectives, deliverability, infrastructure, email design and development, email marketing strategy, email copies, and AMP emails.</p>
<p>We used Mailmodo’s conditional multi-step forms to make the questionnaire conditional so that the respondents only got questions related to their expertise. For example, if the respondents were deliverability experts, they would be asked questions belonging to the “Deliverability/Infrastructure” section.</p>
<h3 id="about-our-respondents">About our respondents</h3>
<p>We reached out to several email marketers, email developers, email designers, deliverability experts, etc., from around the world. Our surveyors hailed from over 150 B2B and B2C companies like G2, Plum HQ, MoEngage, Leena AI, Miro, SuperMoney, Scaler etc.</p>

<p>On average, people usually get a 70-100% inbox placement rate which is why when it goes below 70%, it&#39;s a cause for concern. It means that a significant amount of their emails are landing in spam.</p>
<div class="highlight-gray">

  

  

<p><strong>Action pointers:</strong> Use deliverability tools like Google postmaster, spark post inbox tracker, etc., to estimate your email deliverability rate and IPR.

<p>6.7% of respondents didn&#39;t do any domain warm-up. While this is good, we also see that more than 33% spent less than 21 days warming up their domains.</p>
<p>It shows that although more email marketers are warming up their domains before sending emails, they are not doing it for the necessary amount of time.</p>

<p>Google Postmaster is a tool you use to track email campaigns you send to Gmail users and get information on your domain, IP reputation, delivery errors, spam rate, etc. But, not a lot of marketers know of it or use to its potential. And we found out from our survey that even email deliverability experts do not know what Google Postmaster is.</p>

<p>Not a lot of email marketers are utilizing BIMI when compared to SPF, DMARC, and DKIM to authenticate their emails. And it’s probably because it’s not as crucial as the others for deliverability.</p>

<p>Nearly 73.3% of people are using various tools like drag-and-drop email editors or email template creators to create their email templates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these 20% of surveyors are still using code to create email templates from scratch and are losing valuable time coding their emails when they could have been using tools to create templates much faster and easier.</p>

<p><strong>Action pointers:</strong> If you are currently coding your emails from scratch, check out template creators or editors in ESPs like Mailmodo for your next campaign.

Yes- 26.7, No-73.3" ></p>
<p>26.7% of the surveyors had sent image only email campaigns in 2022. As we discussed previously in the email marketing myths chapter, image only emails are not good as they can cause accessibility issues, spam issues, bad reading experience, etc. Email clients often block image-only emails as a first line of defense against spam. The second line of defense is to route image-only emails directly to the junk or spam folder.</p>

<p>&quot;There are seemingly limitless ways to create and send an email, and even more folks on social media telling you exactly how you can apply their methods of email success to your own business. But there&#39;s no guarantee those strategies will work for you. Finding your own path to success with email can be a challenge, to say the least.</p>
<p>Before you start planning, take time to define (or re-assess) your goals with email. And make sure everyone involved, from your day-to-day practitioners to your leadership team, is aligned on what you&#39;re really trying to accomplish with your email program. Misalignment leads to wasted time, effort, and budget and most certainly will not help you reach your targets in 2023.</p>
<p>Whether you&#39;re aiming to encourage a specific action, such as a sale or website visit, or if you have another objective in mind, such as growing your email list, driving engagement with subscribers, or building awareness, use those goals as a jumping off point to inform your action plan. The strategies, tactics, and technologies you employ, as well as the segmentation, style, and tone of your email, call-to-action, timing, and frequency... ALL of it needs to be built around achieving your goals. And you can&#39;t do that if you&#39;re unclear about what those goals are.&quot;

<blockquote>
<p>“Automation will be key in 2023. Map out your customer journey from awareness through to loyalty. Plan each of your email communications by using mapping tools to design your email marketing strategy based on your key business related goals. Once you have these defined, automate as much as possible. Use the right tools that will enable you to deliver on this.”
<br>- Komal Helyer, DMA </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Email marketing works - so our consumer&#39;s inboxes are getting busier. So you really need to stand out in the crowd - not just with attractive offers and aesthetically - pleasing designs - but with calling upon a &#39;helpful&#39; mindset. This simply means that every subject line, CTA, copy, imagery (and landing pages) are designed and written with the customer and their needs in mind. They came on your list for a reason - how can you help them to achieve their objective? A helpful mindset will make it easy for you to become more customer-centric and less brand-centric in your copy, and in turn, help you to stand out in the inbox.”
<br>- Kath Pay, <a href="https://www.holisticemailmarketing.com">Holistic Email Marketing</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most important tip for email marketers is to provide value and relevance to their subscribers. Most people don&#39;t actually implement this tip, although it may seem simple. As well as helping with ROI, it also helps maintain your sender reputation and deliverability rates.</p>
<p>Providing value in email means sending targeted and personalized emails that are of interest to your subscribers and that also convert. By sending emails that are relevant to your subscribers&#39; interests and needs, you can increase the chances that they will open and click on your emails and take desired actions.</p>
<p>To create more targeted and relevant emails, you can segment your email list based on factors such as subscriber preferences, demographics, and past engagement. You can then create customized email campaigns for each segment to provide more personalized and relevant content to your subscribers. Automations can also be created using segments and better targeting.</p>
<p>Overall, by focusing on providing value and relevance to your subscribers, you can create more engaging and effective email marketing campaigns and achieve your marketing goals.&quot;
<br>- <a href="http://yannatorry.com">Yanna-Torry Aspraki</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Focus on creating user journey campaigns. An end user receives dozens of emails from dozens of brands every day, many emails from several competing brands. Nurture the customers of your brand as you would any relationship - it generates sustainable good results.</p>
<p>Moreover, back off when you see negative signals - those 2-3 days of pause and slowing down when the metrics start to fall can save you several weeks spent on fixing a deliverability issue.&quot;
<br>- Sadikshya Pant, <a href="https://www.moengage.com/">Moengage</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“My tip for email marketers would be to focus on understanding the customer&#39;s journey and using technology and aggregated data to gain insights into the customer&#39;s sentiment towards the brand. By understanding where the customer is in their journey and how they feel about the brand, email marketers can create more targeted and relevant content that resonates with the customer and helps to move them further along the journey. This can help to improve conversions and overall customer engagement.</p>
<p>Ohhh... and start mastering writing prompts for the AI.&quot;

<blockquote>
<p>“Be original and never stop testing. I believe that the outcome of email marketing can always be better, so you should not rest on your laurels. Implement error-based learning, discover what works and what doesn&#39;t - test out even the craziest ideas. I promise it will be worth it!”
<br>- Martyna, <a href="https://photoaid.com/passport-photos">PhotoAiD</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“One thing I&#39;ll be focusing on in 2023 is emailing more. The focus is on high-quality emails, but it&#39;s about delivering value more than once or twice a month. Educate more than your competition in order to get seen.”
<br>- Ravi Davda, <a href="https://www.rockstarmarketing.co.uk/">Rockstar Marketing</a></p>

<p>“Make it concrete with visuals. Our audience always asks us what our course structure and course benefits are. By giving them a concrete visual of the value they’re getting, our growth increased - largely because we were able to properly communicate that our product aligns with their goals.”

<p>“Leverage AI for generating ideas for the email copy, always clean your lists routinely, include valuable information in your newsletter, keep the content tone aligned well to your TG, and always analyze send timing vs open and reply rates.”
<br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-sandilya/">Aman Sandilya</a>, WareIQ</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I would say focus on visuals rather than having long passages in the email. People are busy and don&#39;t want to read an essay in their inbox. It&#39;s all about getting straight to the point. The way you design your email should be seamless and pleasant to look at but also provide a clear message and call to action so that you can convey your message to your audience quickly and easily.”
<br>- Bilawal G, <a href="https://presspitch.io/">Press Pitch</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Test, test, test:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Test your deliverability - perform inboxing seed tests,</p>
</li>
<li><p>Test your content - see how it affects inboxing,</p>
</li>
<li><p>Test your resonance with the audience - observe how your audience &gt;engages to different messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra... keep your email list clean.”
<br>- Radek Kaczynski, <a href="https://www.usebouncer.com">Bouncer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I predict that email marketers will need to focus on creating engaging content that is tailored to their audience. Additionally, personalization will be key, so marketers should take the time to learn more about their subscribers and create messages that are relevant to their interests. Lastly, automated email marketing will continue to grow in popularity, so marketers should invest in tools and platforms that can help them automate their campaigns.”
<br>- Clint L. Sanchez, <a href="https://blaksheepcreative.com">BlakSheep Creative</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Going into 2023, invest more heavily on collecting first party data and transforming it into actionable insights. This will help you to effectively personalize your email marketing campaigns and drive up their ROI. Data privacy is going to be even more crucial in 2023. Optimizing how you collect, analyze and use first party data in your campaigns will enable you to adhere to customers&#39; demand for privacy while still meeting their expectations for personalization.”
<br>- Mark McShane, <a href="https://sheffieldfirstaidcourses.co.uk/">Sheffield First Aid Courses</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“2023 will see brands and businesses think about the bigger picture. Email marketing will bolster omnichannel digital marketing strategies alongside performance marketing, social media, website experiences, loyalty programs, SMS and more. Personalized messaging will be considered not only in email marketing but weaved into every possible stage of the customer journey for a seamless experience and consistent messaging.”
<br>- Requelle, <a href="https://www.reloadmedia.com.au/">Reload Media</a></p>

<br>- Sriram, <a href="http://smartadvisors.in">Smart Advisors</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Have conversations with your email subscribers and ask questions at the end of the email. If they reply, that would actually help in the long run with open rates. Furthermore, don&#39;t stop experimenting. Sometimes, try plain text as well as highly responsive email.”

<p>“Don&#39;t be over-dependent on AI writing tools especially for cold outreach. Your readers are smart hence sooner or later they can point out whether a particular email is written &quot;for me&quot; by a real human being or a bot. Of course, use AI tools to generate ideas but don&#39;t blindly follow it to an extent where you lose your style and tone.”

<p>“Extending data visibility beyond the regular metrics. Data is the largest part of strategy building for success of any project.

So, let's start on the right foot by addressing any email marketing myths and misconceptions to ensure you have a better email marketing experience in 2023.\n\n### Myth #1: It's a good idea to remove/hide the unsubscribe button to reduce unsubscribes.\n\n**Fact: By removing the unsubscribe button, you will lower the number of unsubscribes. But is it a GOOD idea? Definitely not.**\n\n  \n\nHere’s why:\n\n- **Increase your chances of landing in spam**  \nWhen you remove the unsubscribe button, you are caging people in your email list. This will only enrage them and encourage them to report you by marking your emails as spam. Thus your domain reputation will go down the drain, and your emails will start landing in spam. By doing this, you are essentially shooting yourself in the foot and ruining your email marketing efforts.\n\n- **Legal reasons**\n    \nFirstly, you will be violating the GDPR, as per which you are required to provide an easy way for people to opt out. The GDPR' Article 7(3) reads:​\n\n**\"The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her​ consent at any time […] It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.\"​**\n\nWhen you remove the unsubscribe button, you will violate this, and this action could have financial and legal consequences. Read more about the [consequences of GDPR violations](https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/gdpr/#fines-for-non-compliance-to-gdpr-email-marketing?utm_source=ebook\u0026utm_medium=stateofemail2023\u0026utm_campaign=link) in our guide.\n\nYou will also be violating other legal policies like the [CAN-SPAM](https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/can-spam/?utm_source=ebook\u0026utm_medium=stateofemail2023\u0026utm_campaign=link) Act.\n\n- **Damages your credibility and reputation**\n    \nWhen you remove the unsubscribe option from your emails, you are taking away the right to consent from your subscribers. That’s not ethical and will jeopardize your brand image and credibility for building a long-term relationship with your audience.\n\n### Myth #2: Avoiding spam trigger words can help you land in the inbox\n\n  \n\n**Fact: No. By simply avoiding spam words, you can no longer avoid the spam folder.**\n\nBack in the 1970s and 80s when email marketing became popular, spam filters used to look out for several spammy words to understand which emails were spam and which weren’t. And email marketers could avoid those words to avoid triggering spam filters. But, spammers had also used this technique to enter the inbox, so spam filters had to become smarter to stop spammers.\n\n  \n\nSo, spam filters used by mailbox providers and internet service providers started to look beyond just a few words to identify spammers. As we mentioned previously factors like IP and domain reputation, authentication, email engagement, etc. play a bigger role in determining whether your emails will land in spam.\n\n  \n\nSo, you need to focus on the above-mentioned factors rather than trying to avoid spam words if you want to land in people’s inboxes. Read this [article](https://www.litmus.com/blog/why-spam-trigger-words-are-a-thing-of-the-past/) by Litmus to get more information about this.\n\n\n\u003e “Use Targeted List: Always send out emails to a very targeted list of people who have opted in to receive your content. If this is not done, it will increase your unsubscribe rate and your spam rate.”\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Rohan, [Biking Know How](https://bikingknowhow.com/)\n\n### Myth #3: Google is killing AMP emails\n\n**Fact: Google is deprioritizing AMP HTML for the web, not AMP for Emails.**\n\n People have misinterpreted the phrase “Google kills AMP” that has been going around everywhere as Google killing AMP for Email, but that is not true. Google has deprioritized AMP HTML for web pages.\n\n  \n\nPreviously Google has been ranking web pages with Google AMP integration higher because they had allegedly prioritized those using their tech. But, in April 2021, [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/amp/about-amp) announced that AMP would no longer be considered a ranking factor for web pages. Read this [article](https://www.theregister.com/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad/) to know more about how Google “killed” AMP web pages. So clearly, this has nothing to do with AMP for Email, which remains unscathed.\n\n  \n\nIn fact, interactive emails are here to stay. Microsoft recently developed its version of interactive emails called [Actionable Messages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/). Actionable Messages are similar to AMP emails, allowing users to engage with the email without leaving the inbox. However, they are still limited as they can only be used internally to send to certain Office 365/Exchange Online Server users. Whereas AMP for emails is supported by Gmail, Yahoo, Mail.ru, and FairEmail. \n\n### Myth #4: AMP emails will automatically help improve email deliverability.\n\n**Fact: Not necessarily.** \n\nTo send AMP emails, people must complete all the sender id authentication protocols and get whitelisted with Gmail, Yahoo mail, or Mail.ru. And while authentication can help improve your chances of landing in the inbox, it's not necessarily guaranteed.\n\n  \n\n**Email deliverability is more than just authentication.** Several other factors determine whether or not your emails will get delivered to the inbox, like IP \u0026 domain reputation, sender reputation, email sending frequency \u0026 volume, email list acquisition \u0026 hygiene practices, etc.\n\n  \n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight-gray\"\n\n\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e 💡 Related guide: \u003ca href=\"https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/email-deliverability/?utm_source=ebook\u0026utm_medium=stateofemail2023\u0026utm_campaign=link\"\u003eEverything You Need to Know About Email Deliverability\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n### Myth #5: Emojis in the subject line can cause deliverability issues\n\n**Fact: Emojis don't cause deliverability issues.**\n\n There is no data available to prove that using emojis will increase your chance of landing in spam.\n\n  \n\nSome people have seen a correlation between emojis and spam in their campaigns, but it's usually not the emojis themselves but how they have been used. If you use them in a way that annoys your audience or makes you seem suspicious, they might mark your email as spam.\n\n  \n\nFor example, if your subject line is **“❤️ Valentine’s Day sale 10% off 🎁”** your audience might not have a problem with the subject line. But if you overuse emojis or use inappropriate ones like **“❤️❤️❤️ Valentine's Day 🍑🍑🍑,”** it might prompt them to mark you as spam.\n\n  \n\nAlso, overuse of emojis can cause accessibility issues as it would be a bad experience for people who use screen readers. For example, this is how a screen reader would read these subject lines:\n\n  \n\n-   **❤️ Valentine’s Day sale 10% off 🎁** - “Red heart Valentine’s Day sale 10% off wrapped gift”\n    \n\n  \n\n-   **❤️❤️❤️ Valentine's Day 🍑🍑🍑** - “Red heart Red heart Red heart Valentine’s Day sale 10% off peach peach peach”\n    \n\n  \n\nHere are some best practices you can follow if you want to add emojis to your subject line:\n\n-   Use only one emoji per subject line if you could.\n    \n-   Put it at the end of the subject line like **“Valentine’s Day sale 10% off 🎁.”**\n    \n-   Don’t use emojis in between the subject line as they break the sentence flow when read by screen readers. \n\n\u003e “In 2023, it's time to stop treating emails as transactional pieces of content. Instead, it is time to delight your end users with the kind of content that they'd like to read and talk to them in their language, as you would with a friend. And get your basics right — accessibility and readability across platforms and devices.”\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Tejas Kinger, [Plum HQ](http://www.plumhq.com/)\n\n### Myth #6: It’s okay to send image-only emails.\n\n**Fact: No, it's not.**\n\nBrands usually send them because it's easier to create these than an HTML or AMP email. But it’s a bad strategy to send image-only emails for the following reasons:\n\n- **Accessibility issues**\nYour email will not be accessible to everyone as screen readers or voice assistants used by blind and visually impaired individuals cannot read text inside an image.\n\n- **Potential spam issues** \nImage-only emails are generally used by spammers as spam filters can't read the text in images. So, email clients usually block image-only emails from being delivered or route them to the spam folder.\n\n- **Failure to load or Increase in load time**\nWhen the reader's internet is slow, your image-only email will not load immediately. So they might have to wait a while to know what your email is about or might never be able to read it.\n\n- **Bad reader experience**\nImage-only emails are usually not dark mode friendly as they have a certain background color that doesn’t change in dark mode. So readers are taken aback by the bright background when they are accustomed to reading with a dark background.\n\nEven if you try to make the image dark mode-friendly by using a PNG image with no background, it won't work. This is because while the background is now dark in dark mode, the text is also dark making it impossible to read.\n\nAnd there are other issues associated with image-only emails, like responsiveness. All you need to know is that image-only emails are not worth it, and you’ll see better results with normal emails like all text, HTML, or AMP.\n\n### Myth #7: Unsubscribes are a bad sign.\n\n**Fact: Not always true.**\n\nUnsubscribes might be devastating for marketers who assume it means they are failing in their marketing efforts. But that's not the case - unsubscribes can be a good thing.\n\n  \n\nUnsubscribe action shows that the person wasn't an engaged prospect or is someone who is no longer interested in your offering. So they wouldn't have bought from you even if they had stayed. Unsubscribe events help you to have a filtered list of people who are interested in your product.\n\n  \nSo, going forward, don’t dwell on the number of unsubscribes. Rather, focus on engagement (open rate, CTOR) and conversions. And, if you avoid a high unsubscribe number, you should implement a [sunset policy](https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/sunset-policy/?utm_source=ebook\u0026utm_medium=stateofemail2023\u0026utm_campaign=link) and remove inactive prospects from your list before they choose to unsubscribe.  \n\n\u003e“Ask yourself before sending any email: what’s in it for the recipient? Am I sending this to benefit me, or the recipient?”\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Natalie Jackson, Co-host, [Humans of Email](http://humansofemail.com)\n\n\u003e“Get everyone involved in a project from start to finish together before you start, the strategy team, email designer, email coder, the web team, think about all the people in the business it will pass through and get everyone to put their heads together - you'll be amazed at the number of email marketers that work in silo from all the other departments!”\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Jay Oram, Head of Dev, [Action Rocket](http://actionrocket.co)\n\n\u003e“Revisit your welcome series — it's one of the best ways to build relationships with your readers.
