When emails are simple to read and navigate on any device, subscribers are more likely to interact with the content.\nThese templates are coded and designed to adapt and adjust their layout, formatting, and content to ensure readability and usability on desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.\n\n\n## What makes our responsive email templates special?\n Apart from being responsive across all devices, these templates are also interactive. This means customers can engage directly with the content, whether it's filling out forms, taking polls, or exploring products, all within the email itself. No need to navigate elsewhere!\nHere’s how we bring interactivity to emails with a few key features:\n\n - **Calculators:** Suppose a SaaS company sends an email offering a free tool to project revenue growth. Customers can input the number of expected subscribers and their subscription tier right inside the email, and the MRR calculator instantly shows their projected monthly earnings. With these calculators, you're offering value upfront—giving customers the tools to make informed decisions faster and more conveniently. There is no need to navigate to a separate webpage or use external tools.\n - **Polls \u0026 Surveys:** Quick polls embedded in emails let you collect instant feedback, helping you understand customer preferences and make data-driven decisions.\nExample: Suppose a clothing retailer sends an email asking, \"Which color do you love most for fall?\" Customers can vote between shades like mustard yellow, maroon, or forest green without leaving their inbox.\n- **Ratings:** Collect star ratings or feedback on recent purchases directly from the email. Customers can leave reviews quickly, without visiting your website.\nExample: A hotel sends a post-stay email asking guests to rate their experience with a simple 1–5 star rating system.\n- **'Add to cart' options within emails:** Sell products directly through your email. Customers can view, select, and purchase items within the email, streamlining the shopping experience.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the interactive widgets you can use in your emails.

Subscribers can quickly skim through your email, find the information they need, and take action without any hassle. Emails that are easy to read are more likely to keep your audience engaged.\n - **Higher Mobile Open Rates**: Since over **60% of emails** are opened on mobile devices, responsive design ensures that your content looks appealing on the go. Subscribers are more likely to engage when the email is formatted perfectly for their screen, making it more likely they’ll click through to your website or landing page.\n - **Reduced Bounce Rates**: Non-responsive emails often appear broken on mobile devices, leading to frustration and higher bounce rates.\n - **Seamless Interaction**: Interactive elements such as buttons, forms, or links are easier to engage with on responsive emails.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"email-templates-md-content-box\"\u003e\n\n### Highlights of Responsive Email Template\n\n- Changes to fit different screen sizes.\n- The text is visible and legible\n- Clear, engaging design \n- Clean layout that enhances readability and engagement.\n- The template adheres to all email accessibility guidelines.\n\n### How to Customize the Referral Email Template\n\n1.

When emails are simple to read and navigate on any device, subscribers are more likely to interact with the content.\nThese templates are coded and designed to adapt and adjust their layout, formatting, and content to ensure readability and usability on desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.\n\n\n## What makes our responsive email templates special?\n Apart from being responsive across all devices, these templates are also interactive. This means customers can engage directly with the content, whether it's filling out forms, taking polls, or exploring products, all within the email itself. No need to navigate elsewhere!\nHere’s how we bring interactivity to emails with a few key features:\n\n - **Calculators:** Suppose a SaaS company sends an email offering a free tool to project revenue growth. Customers can input the number of expected subscribers and their subscription tier right inside the email, and the MRR calculator instantly shows their projected monthly earnings. With these calculators, you're offering value upfront—giving customers the tools to make informed decisions faster and more conveniently. There is no need to navigate to a separate webpage or use external tools.\n - **Polls \u0026 Surveys:** Quick polls embedded in emails let you collect instant feedback, helping you understand customer preferences and make data-driven decisions.\nExample: Suppose a clothing retailer sends an email asking, \"Which color do you love most for fall?\" Customers can vote between shades like mustard yellow, maroon, or forest green without leaving their inbox.\n- **Ratings:** Collect star ratings or feedback on recent purchases directly from the email. Customers can leave reviews quickly, without visiting your website.\nExample: A hotel sends a post-stay email asking guests to rate their experience with a simple 1–5 star rating system.\n- **'Add to cart' options within emails:** Sell products directly through your email. Customers can view, select, and purchase items within the email, streamlining the shopping experience.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the interactive widgets you can use in your emails. For a full list of interactive email widgets, you can check it [here](https://www.mailmodo.com/interactive-email-library/)\n\n## Why should you use responsive email templates?\n\nHere are key reasons why responsive email templates drive higher engagement:\n\n - **Improved Readability**:These emails ensure that the text is legible, no matter what device you are using. Subscribers can quickly skim through your email, find the information they need, and take action without any hassle. Emails that are easy to read are more likely to keep your audience engaged.\n - **Higher Mobile Open Rates**: Since over **60% of emails** are opened on mobile devices, responsive design ensures that your content looks appealing on the go. Subscribers are more likely to engage when the email is formatted perfectly for their screen, making it more likely they’ll click through to your website or landing page.\n - **Reduced Bounce Rates**: Non-responsive emails often appear broken on mobile devices, leading to frustration and higher bounce rates.\n - **Seamless Interaction**: Interactive elements such as buttons, forms, or links are easier to engage with on responsive emails.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"email-templates-md-content-box\"\u003e\n\n### Highlights of Responsive Email Template\n\n- Changes to fit different screen sizes.\n- The text is visible and legible\n- Clear, engaging design \n- Clean layout that enhances readability and engagement.\n- The template adheres to all email accessibility guidelines.\n\n### How to Customize the Referral Email Template\n\n1.
